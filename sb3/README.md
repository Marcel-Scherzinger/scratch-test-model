# `sb3`

Contains the Scratch files for testing the code.
The further folder should contain *many* different files so that testing for parsing errors
is as representative as possible. This large collection of files should be ignored by Git.

(Every Scratch file contains sounds, ... by default so a huge amount of them would disturb Git.)
